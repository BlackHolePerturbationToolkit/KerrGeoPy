	abstract = {Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

	abstract = {Aims: We present the first fully relativistic study of gravitational radiation from bodies in circular equatorial orbits around the massive black hole at the Galactic center, Sgr A* and we assess the detectability of various kinds of objects by the gravitational wave detector LISA. Methods: Our computations are based on the theory of perturbations of the Kerr spacetime and take into account the Roche limit induced by tidal forces in the Kerr metric. The signal-to-noise ratio in the LISA detector, as well as the time spent in LISA band, are evaluated. We have implemented all the computational tools in an open-source SageMath package, within the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit framework. Results: We find that white dwarfs, neutrons stars, stellar black holes, primordial black holes of mass larger than 10-4 M⊙, main-sequence stars of mass lower than ∼2.5 M⊙, and brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A* are all detectable in one year of LISA data with a signal-to-noise ratio above 10 for at least 105 years in the slow inspiral towards either the innermost stable circular orbit (compact objects) or the Roche limit (main-sequence stars and brown dwarfs). The longest times in-band, of the order of 106 years, are achieved for primordial black holes of mass ∼10-3 M⊙ down to 10-5 M⊙, depending on the spin of Sgr A*, as well as for brown dwarfs, just followed by white dwarfs and low mass main-sequence stars. The long time in-band of these objects makes Sgr A* a valuable target for LISA. We also consider bodies on close circular orbits around the massive black hole in the nucleus of the nearby galaxy M 32 and find that, among them, compact objects and brown dwarfs stay for 103-104 years in LISA band with a one-year signal-to-noise ratio above ten.},

	abstract = {Black hole spacetimes, like the Kerr spacetime, admit both stable and plunging orbits, separated in parameter space by the separatrix. Determining the location of the separatrix is of fundamental interest in understanding black holes, and is of crucial importance for modeling extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Previous numerical approaches to locating the Kerr separatrix were not always efficient or stable across all of parameter space. In this paper we show that the Kerr separatrix is the zero set of a single polynomial in parameter space. This gives two main results. First, we thoroughly analyze special cases (extreme Kerr, polar orbits, etc.), finding strict bounds on the limits of roots, and unifying a number of results in the literature. Second, we pose a stable numerical method which is guaranteed to quickly and robustly converge to the separatrix. This new approach is implemented in the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit, and results in a ∼45 × speedup over the prior robust approach.},

Mino time decouples the radial and the polar motion of a particle and hence leads to forms more useful to estimate three fundamental frequencies, radial, polar and azimuthal motion, for the bound timelike geodesics in Kerr spacetime. This paper gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of the fundamental frequencies. This paper also gives the first derivation of the analytical expressions of all coordinates for the bound timelike geodesics using Mino time. These analytical expressions should be useful not only to investigate physical properties of Kerr geodesics but more importantly to applications related to the estimation of gravitational waves from the extreme mass ratio inspirals.},

We also specialise to the case of test particles plunging from the innermost precessing stable circular orbit (ISSO) and unstable spherical orbits. We find these solutions in the form of elementary and Jacobi elliptic functions parameterised by Mino time. In particular, we demonstrate that solutions for the ISSO case can be determined almost entirely in terms of elementary functions, depending only on the spin parameter of the black hole and the radius of the ISSO. Furthermore, we introduce a new equation that characterises the radial inflow from the ISSO to the horizon, taking into account the inclination. For ease of application, our solutions have been implemented in a Mathematica package that is available as part of the KerrGeodesics package in the Black Hole Perturbation Toolkit.},
